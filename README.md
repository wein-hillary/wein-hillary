### Hi there üëã
- My name is Hillary and my pronouns are she, her, hers. Three words I often use to describe myself are thoughtful, curious, empathetic. My non-work related interests include: language learning, anything outdoorsy or fitness related, and, most importantly, googling ‚Äúwhy are my plants dying‚Äù at 2am. I am comically bad at remembering expressions. Please feel free to ask me more about some of the ones I have gotten wildly wrong (I keep a list). ENFJ, enneagram 2.
### What should you know about my communication style?:
- I am transparent and direct, and will tell you when I have doubts, concerns, or objections. Please do the same with me! I both expect and offer kindness in these interactions. When I have questions, most of them will come up once I have been given time to start work or make headway on a task. Additionally, I sometimes ask questions that are about four steps ahead of where I should be. It comes from being an eager person. 
### How can you best work with me?
- I am an _incredibly_ visual person, if we are working together screenshots, videos, or screen sharing help. Also, make any action items or requests clear! 
### What are my pet peeves?
- Excess or unnecessary noise and loud settings in general are overstimulating to me. I work best in quiet environments and without background noise.
### What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
- I am remarkably competitive, especially with myself! 
- I keep too many tabs open :lol:
